# La station de cryptage

Crypter et decrypter le contenu dans un dossier ou un fichier texte.

## Getting Started

When a document is being added to the toCrypt folder, a service will automatically crypt the document and send it to the crypted folder such that simultaneously the crypted document is added to the toDecrypt folder and another service will in its turn automatically decrypt the document and send it to the decrypted folder.

### Prerequisites

The git repository can either be cloned or the zip file can be downloaded and extracted in "/home/client".


### Installation

You need to execute the file install.sh into your terminal and the job is done using the code : ./install.sh

Sometimes you need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, to do so, the following line of code may be used :chmod +x install.sh

The code will copy itself into your home ~/src 

Note: My code run through the path "/home/client/.."- please make sure that your system's name is "client" and if not so, just change the path in the code.
